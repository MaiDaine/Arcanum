# Arcanum

Arcanum is an Arena Brawler based on the Warlock map on Warcraft III.  
It is a personal project made on my free time.  
  
I'm currently working on physic based interaction between spells and in a near future hope to have a minimal set of 20 spells fully functional.  
Multiplayer is still POC (connection and spell replication works) since round logic is not implemented yet.
